A physical address is a normal address to some kind of information in RAM.

The virtual address does not represent the actual physical address of the object
in memory. The system save virtual address in the table and match to the 
physical address.

So, difference: 
Virtual address can be whatever big since virtual memory is infinitely large for a process.
Physical address is limited by the actual size of memory.
